# CIS221-Course-My-Analytics-Application-Experience
This repository contains my reflections and midterm Jupyter Notebook exercises for the course CIS221: Analytics Application.

3.1. What challenges did I experience in doing Exploratory Data Analysis, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning?

While working on Exploratory Data Analysis, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning, I encountered several challenges that affected how confident and focused I felt throughout the process. One of my main difficulties was dealing with concepts that required deeper analytical thinking, especially when my understanding of some foundational topics was not yet solid. Earlier in the course, I struggled with ideas such as data frames, distinguishing supervised and unsupervised learning, and understanding how KPIs are applied in analytics. Because of these gaps, tasks like identifying relevant variables, spotting meaningful patterns, and interpreting regression results became more overwhelming.

There were also moments when I hesitated to actively participate in class discussions. Sometimes this was because I was unsure of my answers, and other times because I was distracted or multitasking. Missing these opportunities to engage made me feel less confident when applying EDA and regression techniques on my own. Over time, these small challenges added up and made the learning process feel more intimidating than it needed to be.

3.2. What could have been the reasons why these challenges happened, and what did I learn from this experience?

Reflecting on this experience, I can identify several reasons why these challenges occurred. One major reason is that analytics requires a specific way of thinking one that connects data, context, and objectives rather than treating tasks as isolated steps. This aligns with systems thinking theory, which emphasizes that understanding the whole system is necessary to solve complex problems. Since I was not fully confident with the basic concepts, it became harder to understand how advanced analytics processes fit together.

Another reason is cognitive overload. Trying to absorb multiple new concepts at once, while also dealing with distractions, made it difficult to fully process and apply what I was learning. This experience helped me realize that analytics is not just about technical tools or formulas it also requires focus, mental clarity, and structured thinking. Frameworks like 5W1H, cause-and-effect analysis, and aligning KPIs with goals are not just theoretical concepts; they are practical tools that help make analysis more manageable and meaningful.

From this, I learned that I need to be more intentional in my learning approach. Instead of rushing through tasks, I should take time to understand the purpose behind each step. I also realized that class participation plays an important role in building confidence and reinforcing understanding. Most importantly, I learned that analytics involves discipline, curiosity, and reflection, not just technical skills.

3.3. What do I need to do better next time?

Moving forward, I need to improve by being more present and attentive during lessons and avoiding multitasking so I do not miss important explanations or opportunities to participate. I also need to strengthen my foundation by regularly reviewing key concepts such as variable identification, KPI structures, and the logic behind regression analysis. Doing more hands-on practice will help me become more comfortable with analyzing data, identifying patterns, and selecting appropriate models.

Lastly, I want to apply systems thinking more consistently by stepping back, looking at the bigger picture, and reflecting before drawing conclusions. By doing these, I believe I can improve not only my skills in analytics but also my overall learning habits as an Information Systems student.
